#### SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS
After exploring with various questions, below are the conclusions of my observation:
1.	It is discovered that majority of the workforce overall dominated by the Black or African American Race with 35.62%, followed by White Race with 33.84% and lastly Hispanic/Latino with 24.43% while the rest of the race are very small portions in the company.
2.	It was find out that the conventional and Entertainment department was largely dominated by Hispanic/Latino Race with no other race involved in that department. It is a monopolized department.
3.	The distribution of Gender across the organisation has more male with 69.85% than female with 30.15%
4.	The female Hispanic/Latino dominated the conventional and Entertainment department with 100%. All other department all have female and male employees working within the department.
5.	There are more Employee working Full time with 97.70% while the part-time, Temporary, HFD Deferred Term and part-time 30 takes the other percentage.
6.	The only temporary worker can only be found in the park and Recreation Department across the organisation
7.	The analysis shows that there are no significant differences between race groups, gender nor pay gap  
8.	Department with the highest average salary is the Legal Department with Highest average salary of 104959.53
